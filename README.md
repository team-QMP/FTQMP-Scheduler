# Online Scheduler for Quantum Multiprogramming
This repository contains 
- Toy compiler that compiles physical quantum circuit (QuantumCircuit in Qiskit and OpenQASM at the moment) into logical program (using lattice surgery on surface codes with polycube representation)
- Preprocessor and online scheduler and simulator 
- Visualizer for polycubes which export SolidPython object or OpenSCAD files
