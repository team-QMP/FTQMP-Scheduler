# Online Scheduler for Quantum Multiprogramming
This repository contains 
- Toy compiler that compiles physical quantum circuit (QuantumCircuit in Qiskit and OpenQASM at the moment) into a logical program (using lattice surgery on surface codes with polycube representation)
- Preprocessors, an online scheduler, and a simulator 
- Visualizer for polycubes that export SolidPython objects or OpenSCAD files
